## Bindings ##

* Made the bindings much easier to read:
  * Fixed indentation within the generated prejs
  * Removed excessive spacing when using many namespaces

* Renamed the bindings file to "{library_name}_wasm.cpp" instead of "{library_name}.wasm"
  * Ex: MyCppLibrary.cpp -> MyCppLibrary_wasm.cpp
  * Note that this has little impact as this is handled internally by the CMake wrapper for Tolc
