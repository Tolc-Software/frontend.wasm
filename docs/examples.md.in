# Examples #

Each example is is made up of a `C++` section and how it can be used from `javascript`. Each example exports the `Promise` `load{libraryName}`, where `libraryName` is `m` here:

```javascript
var loadm = require('./build/m');

test('Tolc Test', () => {
	loadm().then(m => {
		// The actual example body
		expect(m.sayTen()).toBe(10);
	});
});
```

Since `WebAssembly` is loaded asynchronously, it has to use the `onRuntimeInitialized` callback.

Note that the examples are part of the test suite for `Tolc`, so the `javascript` uses statements from the test framework [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/). You may assume that each test passes if you run the latest version of `Tolc`.
